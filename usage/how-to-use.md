# ðŸ–¥ How to use

Using this library is very simple! Just use the `NameNumerizer` namespace in any piece of code you want to use the library, as in: `using NameNumerizer;`

Just use the `Numerizer` class that contains:

* `NumerizeFiles(string, string[])`

It renames your files to append the track number to their prefixes in their names to make it look like your music album's naming scheme.

It's useful for quickly making your music albums by renaming all your files.
